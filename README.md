### Background Information
An inverted index is an index data structure storing a mapping from content, such as words or numbers, to its locations in a database file, or in a document or a set of documents. The purpose of an inverted index is to allow fast full text searches, at a cost of increased processing when a document is added to the database

### Features

- Users are able to click an 'Upload File to upload book files which also allow multiple uploads.

- Users are able to click a 'Create Index button to create an Index based on data in uploaded files.

- Users are able to search through files that have been indexed which enables:
 - *Searching through selected files*,
 - *Search through all indexed files*
 - *Users will be able to view the result of indexed files and searched words in a tabular format showing*:

           - Title of books
	   - Number of word occurrences in each book if word is found
	- A found or not found icon depending on if the word is found
